# Het2Gene
a phenotype-driven model for gene prioritization.The heterogeneous graph embedding algorithm is used to learn the embedding representation of heterogeneous graph nodes, and the score of candidate pathogenic genes is calculated according to the embedding, so as to prioritize.

# Folder description
The data used in the training model are placed in `./data/` .The edge relation, weight and trained embedding information have been encapsulated by pickle module. In addition, the test data used are also included. In `./models/`, it includes the method of constructing weighted and unweighted graphs, node coding method, training method, test code, etc
